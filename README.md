# ui-copy-demo-astro-tailwind
A simple demo page, strictly copied to the pixel level given an existing web page.

Differences were made in the navigation bar to make a more responsive design across devices.

The project is made using Astro and Tailwind, and deployed without a single JS command.

The project is completely static - just HTML and CSS. Note the side bar menu as a reference.
