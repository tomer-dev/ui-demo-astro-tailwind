# ui-demo-astro-tailwind 🚀

A simple demo page, strictly adhering to specs, given an existing web page.

Differences were made in the navigation bar to make a more responsive design across devices.

The project is made using Astro and Tailwind, and deployed without a single JS command.

The project is completely static - just HTML and CSS. Note the side-bar menu as a reference.
